My name is Sam, I'm a 3rd year CS major and a transfer student.  
I have experience coding in Java, C++ and Python and I have some limited experience with javascript and html. I took CMPSC 56 last quarter and my team made a simple webapp using Java and Spring Boot so I have some understanding about how webapps work. 
In this class I would like to gain more experience developing apps so that I can be a more efficient programmer and problem solver.
