Team Norms!

* Be communicative
    * Push your changes regularly
    * If we split into smaller groups, check github regularly 
    * Make sure your files don't conflict with others! If they do try and catch it early so it's not hard to resolve later!!
* Initially, meet all together until we figure out a workflow


tl;dr
* Be on slack! Tell people what you're doing! 
* Use github! Push/pull/commit code regularly!
