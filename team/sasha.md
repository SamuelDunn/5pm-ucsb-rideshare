Hi! My name's Sasha. I like being outside for extended periods of time and coding. I'm a third year CS major. This is my last lower division CS class. The only upper division classes I've taken are CS138 and CS130A. 

Things I've worked on/am working on (technical experience, if you will)
* Wrote a webapp using sparkjava in CS56 (a lot of copying/pasting, my main contribution was integrating MongoDB)
* A Django webapp (hosted on AWS) for the ucsb excursion club - I worked more on the UX side less on the technical side but still ran the project locally on my laptop a handful of times and have access to the github 
* Learning Node.js to use airtable.com's API to eventually create an app that grants visitors temporary wifi accounts (this is for my on campus job at Bren)

tl;dr: I have some experience working with a handful of different web application frameworks, excited to dive deeper into the process and write an app from scratch.
